## Technologies and Concepts

- **React**: I used it to render the UI.
- **Tailwind CSS**: I chose it for fast and efficient styling.
- **Component Based Design**: I aimed to create page components in a modular way.
- **Project Structure and Organization**: I tried to keep the file and folder structure organized and clear.
